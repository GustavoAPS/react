# React

Use this command to create the app
```bash
npm create vite@latest swoley-fit -- --template react
```
Some information on what was created:
- index.html : there is a div with the id of root, the entire react app is rendered here, by the script main.jsx.
- App.jsx: Is the hub of the app and probably where you will work the most.

Next step is to install tailwind.

Remember: in react, class is substituted by className

In react related pieces of functionality and code are called components.

- <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">.jsx :</span>
 is the file extension used by react, it lets you write code that looks like html and javascript in the same file


- <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Component: </span>
It is a function and has the same name of the file, file name and function name must be captalized.

- React Fragments: empty divs

- We can import components inside other components and render them as HTML tags.
